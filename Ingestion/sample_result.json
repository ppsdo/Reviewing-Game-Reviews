Its underground layer is a cool additional system that has you expanding, improving, and defending your mining operation in a way that matches the laid back pace of the surface nicely. At the same time, SteamWorld Build\u2019s simplicity cuts both ways, and there isn\u2019t much variety on return trips aside from fitting the old bits into new maps. That makes it a refreshing city builder worthy of a few fun weekends, but not a particularly deep one you're likely to boot up year after year.", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D4HMQ72YFSw/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D4HMQ72YFSw/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D4HMQ72YFSw/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D4HMQ72YFSw/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/D4HMQ72YFSw/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "IGN", "playlistId": "PLraFbwCoisJBTl0oXn8UoUam5HXWUZ7ES", "position": 0, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "D4HMQ72YFSw"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "IGN", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "D4HMQ72YFSw", "videoPublishedAt": "2023-11-30T01:00:43Z"}, "status": {"privacyStatus": "public"}}], "pageInfo": {"totalResults": 2178, "resultsPerPage": 1}}
