Running across rooftops in Renaissance-era Italy and sneaking through the streets of ancient Athens is a blast, and the fact that none of that made me want to hurl is a testament to just how much Nexus takes advantage of the Meta Quest 3\u2019s shiny new hardware. It\u2019s unfortunate that combat seems like an afterthought compared to the rest of Nexus\u2019s polished systems, and occasional technical issues and immersion-breaking bugs definitely pulled me out of the experience from time to time. Even so, Nexus has reignited my interest in virtual reality, as only dancing through the streets of Venice as Ezio could do \u2013 and it feels good to be back.\n\n#IGN #Gaming #AssassinsCreed", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0S_BSTwg5Y/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0S_BSTwg5Y/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0S_BSTwg5Y/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0S_BSTwg5Y/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E0S_BSTwg5Y/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "IGN", "playlistId": "PLraFbwCoisJBTl0oXn8UoUam5HXWUZ7ES", "position": 11, "resourceId": {"kind": "youtube#video", "videoId": "E0S_BSTwg5Y"}, "videoOwnerChannelTitle": "IGN", "videoOwnerChannelId": "UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw"}, "contentDetails": {"videoId": "E0S_BSTwg5Y", "videoPublishedAt": "2023-11-16T18:31:14Z"}, "status": {"privacyStatus": "public"}}, {"kind": "youtube#playlistItem", "etag": "tTZCiXRAxodXiJSZ1WyS_BaueSc", "id": "UExyYUZid0NvaXNKQlRsMG9YbjhVb1VhbTVIWFdVWjdFUy45QTA5N0VENTg1MTE0QkE0", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2023-11-16T00:07:16Z", "channelId": "UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Multiplayer Review", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Multiplayer reviewed by Stella Chung on PC.

Also available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\nAs a big fan of both The Lord of the Rings and survival games, I was enticed by the idea that I can dive into a genre I already know and love with the rich lore of Middle-earth to keep me company (as well as a party of friends), but it\u2019s disappointing to see such a promising concept do little more than a barely passable impression of better games. Combat is dull and repetitive, owing to overused enemy types and braindead AI, and limited mining opportunities or freedom with settlement building throws a wet blanket over the creativity that\u2019s typically a selling point for the genre. Throw in rough technical performance and it becomes difficult to recommend Return to Moria to even my fellow Tolkien stans.

It can occasionally be frustrating when the random elements stack the deck completely against you, but strong persistent upgrade options make each run still feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something.
